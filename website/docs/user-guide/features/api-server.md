# API Server

The API server exposes hermes-agent as an OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint. Any frontend that speaks the OpenAI format — Open WebUI, LobeChat, LibreChat, NextChat, ChatBox, and hundreds more — can connect to hermes-agent and use it as a backend.

Your agent handles requests with its full toolset (terminal, file operations, web search, memory, skills) and returns the final response. When streaming, tool progress indicators appear inline so frontends can show what the agent is doing.

:::tip One backend covers models + tools
Hermes itself needs a configured provider and tool backends for the API server to be useful. A [Nous Portal](/user-guide/features/tool-gateway) subscription handles both — 300+ models plus web/image/TTS/browser via the Tool Gateway. Run `hermes setup --portal` once before starting the API server and frontends like Open WebUI or LobeChat get a fully tool-equipped backend.
:::

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable the API server

Add to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
API_SERVER_KEY=change-me-local-dev
# Optional: only if a browser must call Hermes directly
# API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Start the gateway

```bash
hermes gateway
```

You'll see:

```
[API Server] API server listening on http://127.0.0.1:8642
```

### 3. Connect a frontend

Point any OpenAI-compatible client at `http://localhost:8642/v1`:

```bash
# Test with curl
curl http://localhost:8642/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer change-me-local-dev" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "hermes-agent", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

Or connect Open WebUI, LobeChat, or any other frontend — see the [Open WebUI integration guide](/user-guide/messaging/open-webui) for step-by-step instructions.

## Endpoints

### POST /v1/chat/completions

Standard OpenAI Chat Completions format. Stateless — the full conversation is included in each request via the `messages` array.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "model": "hermes-agent",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a Python expert."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a fibonacci function"}
  ],
  "stream": false
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1710000000,
  "model": "hermes-agent",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's a fibonacci function..."},
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 50, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 250}
}
```

**Inline image input:** user messages may send `content` as an array of `text` and `image_url` parts. Both remote `http(s)` URLs and `data:image/...` URLs are supported:

```json
{
  "model": "hermes-agent",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"},
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/cat.png", "detail": "high"}}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Uploaded files (`file` / `input_file` / `file_id`) and non-image `data:` URLs return `400 unsupported_content_type`.

**Streaming** (`"stream": true`): Returns Server-Sent Events (SSE) with token-by-token response chunks. For **Chat Completions**, the stream uses standard `chat.completion.chunk` events plus Hermes' custom `hermes.tool.progress` event for tool-start UX. For **Responses**, the stream uses OpenAI Responses event types such as `response.created`, `response.output_text.delta`, `response.output_item.added`, `response.output_item.done`, and `response.completed`.

**Tool progress in streams**:
- **Chat Completions**: Hermes emits `event: hermes.tool.progress` for tool-start visibility without polluting persisted assistant text.
- **Responses**: Hermes emits spec-native `function_call` and `function_call_output` output items during the SSE stream, so clients can render structured tool UI in real time.

### POST /v1/responses

OpenAI Responses API format. Supports server-side conversation state via `previous_response_id` — the server stores full conversation history (including tool calls and results) so multi-turn context is preserved without the client managing it.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "model": "hermes-agent",
  "input": "What files are in my project?",
  "instructions": "You are a helpful coding assistant.",
  "store": true
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "resp_abc123",
  "object": "response",
  "status": "completed",
  "model": "hermes-agent",
  "output": [
    {"type": "function_call", "name": "terminal", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"ls\"}", "call_id": "call_1"},
    {"type": "function_call_output", "call_id": "call_1", "output": "README.md src/ tests/"},
    {"type": "message", "role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "output_text", "text": "Your project has..."}]}
  ],
  "usage": {"input_tokens": 50, "output_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 250}
}
```

**Inline image input:** `input[].content` can contain `input_text` and `input_image` parts. Both remote URLs and `data:image/...` URLs are supported:

```json
{
  "model": "hermes-agent",
  "input": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "input_text", "text": "Describe this screenshot."},
        {"type": "input_image", "image_url": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K..."}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Uploaded files (`input_file` / `file_id`) and non-image `data:` URLs return `400 unsupported_content_type`.

#### Multi-turn with previous_response_id

Chain responses to maintain full context (including tool calls) across turns:

```json
{
  "input": "Now show me the README",
  "previous_response_id": "resp_abc123"
}
```

The server reconstructs the full conversation from the stored response chain — all previous tool calls and results are preserved. Chained requests also share the same session, so multi-turn conversations appear as a single entry in the dashboard and session history.

#### Named conversations

Use the `conversation` parameter instead of tracking response IDs:

```json
{"input": "Hello", "conversation": "my-project"}
{"input": "What's in src/?", "conversation": "my-project"}
{"input": "Run the tests", "conversation": "my-project"}
```

The server automatically chains to the latest response in that conversation. Like the `/title` command for gateway sessions.

### GET /v1/responses/\{id\}

Retrieve a previously stored response by ID.

### DELETE /v1/responses/\{id\}

Delete a stored response.

### GET /v1/models

Lists the agent as an available model. The advertised model name defaults to the [profile](/user-guide/profiles) name (or `hermes-agent` for the default profile). Required by most frontends for model discovery.

### GET /v1/profiles

Returns the complete profile roster using only canonical IDs and safe routing
state. A configured `API_SERVER_KEY` is always required.

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "version": 1,
  "complete": true,
  "active_profile": "default",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "default",
      "object": "hermes.profile",
      "is_default": true,
      "is_active": true,
      "served": true
    }
  ]
}
```

`served` means the current gateway can serve that profile. In single-profile
mode only the active profile is served; a multiplex gateway serves every
profile in the returned roster. The endpoint never returns profile paths,
descriptions, aliases, provider/model settings, distribution metadata, skill
counts, environment state, or credentials. It fails instead of returning a
partial or malformed inventory.

### GET /v1/profile-runtimes

Returns a complete, read-only runtime identity snapshot for the profile roster.
A configured `API_SERVER_KEY` is always required.

```json
{
  "object": "hermes.profile_runtime.list",
  "version": 1,
  "complete": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "profile_id": "default",
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
    }
  ]
}
```

Only bounded opaque provider/model IDs are returned. URLs, paths,
credential-shaped identifiers, environment names, authentication metadata,
and partial snapshots fail closed. This endpoint grants read visibility only;
it is not a provider-switching API.

### GET /v1/capabilities

Returns a machine-readable description of the API server's stable surface for external UIs, orchestrators, and plugin bridges.

```json
{
  "object": "hermes.api_server.capabilities",
  "platform": "hermes-agent",
  "model": "hermes-agent",
  "auth": {"type": "bearer", "required": true},
  "features": {
    "chat_completions": true,
    "responses_api": true,
    "run_submission": true,
    "run_status": true,
    "run_events_sse": true,
    "run_event_replay": true,
    "run_event_replay_version": 1,
    "run_pending_action_status": true,
    "run_pending_action_status_version": 1,
    "run_runtime_identity": true,
    "run_runtime_identity_version": 1,
    "run_stop": true,
    "run_approval_request_binding": true,
    "run_approval_structured_preview": true,
    "run_approval_preview_version": 1,
    "run_session_continuation": true,
    "run_session_continuation_version": 1,
    "run_session_continuation_exact_revision": true,
    "run_session_continuation_stoppable": true,
    "profile_inventory": true,
    "profile_inventory_version": 1,
    "profile_inventory_complete": true,
    "profile_inventory_requires_api_key": true,
    "profile_runtime_inventory": true,
    "profile_runtime_inventory_version": 1,
    "profile_runtime_inventory_complete": true,
    "profile_runtime_inventory_requires_api_key": true
  }
}
```

Use this endpoint when integrating dashboards, browser UIs, or control planes so they can discover whether the running Hermes version supports runs, streaming, cancellation, and session continuity without depending on private Python internals.

### GET /health

Health check. Returns `{"status": "ok"}`. Also available at **GET /v1/health** for OpenAI-compatible clients that expect the `/v1/` prefix.

### GET /health/detailed

Authenticated readiness check for monitoring and control planes. It reports
bounded status for the active profile's config, state database, configured
model, disk space, gateway/platform state, active API runs, pending process
completions, and active delegations. The response exposes status and counts,
not config values, credentials, paths, commands, queue payloads, or raw errors.

The public `/health` route remains a cheap liveness probe and does not run
readiness checks. A degraded readiness result still uses HTTP 200; inspect the
top-level `status` and `readiness.checks` fields.

## Runs API (streaming-friendly alternative)

In addition to `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses`, the server exposes a **runs** API for long-form sessions where the client wants to subscribe to progress events instead of managing streaming themselves.

### POST /v1/runs

Create a new agent run. Returns a `run_id` that can be used to subscribe to progress events.

```json
{
  "run_id": "run_abc123",
  "status": "started"
}
```

Runs accept a simple `input` string and optional `session_id`, `instructions`, `conversation_history`, or `previous_response_id`. When `session_id` is provided, Hermes surfaces it in the run status so external UIs can correlate runs with their own conversation IDs. That field alone does not load persisted history; use the exact continuation contract below when continuing a Hermes session.

### Continue an exact session through Runs

First request a descriptor for the selected session:

```text
GET /v1/sessions/{session_id}/continuation
```

Hermes resolves a compression root to its current tip and returns a content-free
descriptor bound to that tip and the exact active message identities/history:

```json
{
  "object": "hermes.session.continuation",
  "version": 1,
  "session_id": "resolved-session-tip",
  "revision": "sessionrev_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
}
```

Pass that object unchanged in the next Runs request:

```json
{
  "input": "Continue with the next step",
  "continuation": {
    "version": 1,
    "session_id": "resolved-session-tip",
    "revision": "sessionrev_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
  }
}
```

Hermes recalculates the binding before allocating the run. A changed message,
replaced message identity, newer compression tip, malformed descriptor, or
second active continuation fails closed. Do not combine `continuation` with
`session_id`, `conversation_history`, `previous_response_id`, or a multi-message
input. Once accepted, the turn uses the normal Runs status, events, approval,
and stop endpoints. Descriptors are authenticated binding data, not bearer
credentials or durable leases.

When a controllable run needs an image, `input` may instead be a compact
OpenAI-style content-part array:

```json
{
  "input": [
    {"type": "input_text", "text": "Describe this screenshot."},
    {"type": "input_image", "image_url": "data:image/png;base64,..."}
  ]
}
```

Runs accepts up to four inline PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP images, each up to 5
MiB. It deliberately accepts only `data:image/...;base64` values—no web URLs,
file uploads, or local paths—so this controllable endpoint cannot fetch a
private network URL or inspect the Hermes host. The same Run keeps its usual
status, events, approval, and stop controls. Discover the exact version and
limits through `features.run_inline_images` and `endpoints.run_inline_images`
in `/v1/capabilities` before sending images.

### GET /v1/runs/\{run_id\}

Poll the current run state. This is useful for dashboards that need status without holding an SSE connection open, or for UIs that reconnect after navigation.

```json
{
  "object": "hermes.run",
  "run_id": "run_abc123",
  "status": "completed",
  "session_id": "space-session",
  "runtime": {
    "provider": "openrouter",
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
  },
  "output": "Done.",
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 50,
    "output_tokens": 200,
    "total_tokens": 250,
    "context_tokens": 24000,
    "context_length": 128000
  }
}
```

Statuses are retained briefly after terminal states (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`) for polling and UI reconciliation.
When the provider reports an exact prompt count, `usage.context_tokens` is the
active prompt size for that turn and `usage.context_length` is the active
model window. Hermes emits the two fields only as a valid pair. They are
separate from cumulative billing totals and are omitted when the provider does
not supply a trustworthy measurement. Multi-model MoA turns omit the pair
because their combined advisor usage is not one active prompt size.
While a run is waiting, runtimes advertising
`run_pending_action_status` include the same bounded, request-bound approval or
clarification object emitted by the stream. Clients may use it to recover the
current UI after a genuine stream interruption, but must still validate and
return the exact request ID.

### GET /v1/runs/\{run_id\}/events

Server-Sent Events stream of the run's tool-call progress, token deltas,
effective runtime identity, and lifecycle events. Every event has a monotonic
SSE `id` matching its JSON `sequence` and `event_id`. Each subscriber receives
an independent copy, so one dashboard cannot consume another dashboard's
events.

The server retains a fixed in-memory replay window capped by event count and
aggregate encoded bytes. Events are normalized to a versioned public allowlist
before retention: tool previews, raw commands, and reasoning bodies are not
stored; assistant deltas use cross-chunk buffering before credential/path
redaction. Credential assignment recognition is same-line: horizontal spaces
and tabs may span chunks, while CR/LF terminates the lexical assignment.
Terminal SSE events contain a bounded public output/error preview
with an explicit completeness flag; poll `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}` for the
authoritative bounded terminal result. Reconnect with
`Last-Event-ID: <last verified id>` to receive only later events in order.
Malformed, ahead-of-stream, or expired cursors fail closed. Replay does not
survive a server restart. A live run retains its bounded journal through
approval and clarification waits; the normal client path keeps that same SSE
connection open until the run reaches a terminal event.

Text buffering is flushed before tool, runtime, approval, clarification, and
terminal events so sequence order remains source order. Credential labels and
their following values are treated as one lexical unit even when split across
provider deltas.

### POST /v1/runs/\{run_id\}/stop

Interrupt a running agent turn. The endpoint returns immediately with `{"status": "stopping"}` while Hermes asks the active agent to stop at the next safe interruption point.
The run stays tracked as `stopping` until the executor-backed work exits, then
settles as `cancelled`; requesting stop never hides a worker that is still
running.

### POST /v1/runs/\{run_id\}/approval

Resolve a pending approval for a run that is waiting on a human decision (for example, a tool call gated behind an approval policy). The body carries the approval decision; the run resumes once the decision is recorded. This endpoint is advertised in `/v1/capabilities` as the `run_approval` feature so external UIs can detect support before surfacing an approval prompt.

Request-bound clients send `request_id` and receive a matching
`approval.responded` event. The legacy no-ID form remains supported; its event
may omit `request_id`, so subscribers must reconcile current run status rather
than clearing an exact local request from that unbound acknowledgement.

Approval events include a stable `request_id` and a versioned `preview`. The
preview contains fixed Hermes-owned categories and labels; it does not copy the
command, description, plugin reason, credentials, or paths. Clients that show
approval controls should require the request-binding and structured-preview
capabilities, render only `preview`, and send the same ID back:

```json
{
  "choice": "once",
  "request_id": "7db61e705f29476a8456efcc4ec03f08"
}
```

Hermes resolves only the matching queued request. A stale or unknown ID returns
`409` without resolving a newer request. Exact request binding cannot be
combined with `all` or `resolve_all`.

For compatibility, callers that omit `request_id` retain the older FIFO
behavior. New external UIs should not use that legacy mode for an approval they
displayed because another responder may have changed the queue first.

### POST /v1/runs/\{run_id\}/clarification

When the agent needs a missing detail, the event stream emits a bounded,
secret-redacted `clarify.request` with a stable `request_id` and a versioned
prompt. Choice prompts use server-issued IDs:

```json
{
  "event": "clarify.request",
  "run_id": "run_abc123",
  "request_id": "clarify_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "prompt": {
    "version": 1,
    "type": "choice",
    "question": "Which environment should I use?",
    "choices": [
      {"id": "choice-1", "label": "Staging"},
      {"id": "choice-2", "label": "Production"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Answer that exact request with a choice ID:

```json
{
  "request_id": "clarify_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "response": {"type": "choice", "choice_id": "choice-1"}
}
```

For an open question, send
`{"type": "text", "text": "your answer"}`. Unknown, stale, already answered,
or cross-run request IDs fail closed. Check `run_clarification_response` and
`run_clarification_request_binding` in `/v1/capabilities` before showing this UI.

## Jobs API (background scheduled work)

The server exposes a lightweight jobs CRUD surface for managing scheduled / background agent runs from a remote client. All endpoints are gated behind the same bearer auth.

### GET /v1/jobs

Return a read-only list for dashboards and other clients that only need to show
scheduled work. This endpoint always includes active and paused jobs.

The response contains only the job ID, an opaque label, schedule, enabled state,
last and next run times, status, and an opaque revision. It does not include
prompts, stored names, delivery settings, work directories, or execution
output. Labels use `Cron job <id>` because older Hermes jobs may have copied
prompt text into the stored name. Invalid schedules become
`Schedule unavailable`.

The list is limited to 128 jobs and 256 KiB. Hermes returns an error instead of
truncating a larger list. The endpoint is unavailable unless the API server has
an API key, and every request must use that key. Hermes also keeps the
capability off when the host cannot open the jobs file without following links.

Clients should check `/v1/capabilities` before calling this endpoint. A
compatible server advertises `jobs_inventory` version 1, the row and byte
limits, and the exact `GET /v1/jobs` route. This capability does not grant
permission to create, edit, delete, pause, resume, or run a job.

### GET /api/jobs

List scheduled jobs for Jobs API administration. Add
`?include_disabled=true` to include paused jobs. This broader response is not
the read-only dashboard contract.

### POST /api/jobs

Create a new scheduled job. Body accepts the same shape as `hermes cron` — prompt, schedule, skills, provider override, delivery target.

### GET /api/jobs/\{job_id\}

Fetch a single job's definition and last-run state.

### PATCH /api/jobs/\{job_id\}

Update fields on an existing job (prompt, schedule, etc.). Partial updates are merged.

### DELETE /api/jobs/\{job_id\}

Remove a job. Also cancels any in-flight run.

### POST /api/jobs/\{job_id\}/pause

Pause a job without deleting it. Next-scheduled-run timestamps are suspended until resumed.

### POST /api/jobs/\{job_id\}/resume

Resume a previously paused job.

### POST /api/jobs/\{job_id\}/run

Trigger the job to run immediately, out of schedule.

## Sessions API (session control over REST)

External UIs can manage Hermes sessions over REST without standing up the dashboard. All endpoints are gated by `API_SERVER_KEY` and live under `/api/sessions/*`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/sessions` | List sessions (paginated — `limit`, `offset`, `source`, `include_children`) |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions` | Create an empty session |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/{id}` | Read session metadata |
| `PATCH` | `/api/sessions/{id}` | Update title or `end_reason` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/sessions/{id}` | Delete a session |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/{id}/messages` | Message history for a session |
| `GET` | `/v1/sessions/{id}/continuation` | Issue an exact revision descriptor for a stoppable Runs continuation |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{id}/fork` | Branch the session via `SessionDB` lineage (matches CLI `/branch` semantics) |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{id}/chat` | Run one synchronous agent turn |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{id}/chat/stream` | SSE wrapper over a single turn — emits `assistant.delta`, `tool.started`, `tool.completed`, `run.completed` events |

`/v1/capabilities` advertises the full surface via `session_*` feature flags and `endpoints.session_*` entries so external UIs can detect support and fall back safely. Inline images are supported in `chat` and `chat/stream` payloads (multimodal-aware path).

```bash
# fork a session and run one turn
curl -X POST http://localhost:8642/api/sessions/$ID/fork \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_SERVER_KEY" \
  -d '{"title": "explore alt path"}'

# stream a turn over SSE
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8642/api/sessions/$ID/chat/stream \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_SERVER_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": "what files changed in the last hour?"}'
```

## Skills and toolsets discovery

`GET /v1/skills` and `GET /v1/toolsets` let external clients enumerate the agent's capabilities deterministically over REST instead of asking the model. Both are read-only and gated by `API_SERVER_KEY`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8642/v1/skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_SERVER_KEY"
# → [{"name": "github-pr-workflow", "description": "...", "category": "..."}, ...]

curl http://localhost:8642/v1/toolsets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_SERVER_KEY"
# → [{"name": "core", "label": "...", "description": "...", "enabled": true,
#     "configured": true, "tools": ["read_file", "write_file", ...]}, ...]
```

`/v1/skills` returns the same metadata the skills hub uses internally. `/v1/toolsets` returns toolsets resolved for the `api_server` platform with the concrete `tools` list each one expands to. Both are advertised under `endpoints.*` in `/v1/capabilities`.

## Revision-aware Kanban API

External control planes can use the bearer-authenticated `/v1/kanban` surface
instead of dashboard routes or Kanban database files. Discover it first through
`GET /v1/capabilities`: look for `kanban_api`, `kanban_api_revisioned`, and
`kanban_api_idempotency`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/v1/kanban/boards` | Bounded board records |
| `GET` | `/v1/kanban/profiles?board=default` | Bounded assignee/profile records |
| `GET` / `POST` | `/v1/kanban/tasks?board=default` | List tasks or create one idempotently |
| `GET` | `/v1/kanban/tasks/{task_id}?board=default` | Exact task snapshot and revision |
| `POST` | `/v1/kanban/tasks/{task_id}/actions?board=default` | Revision-bound action and read-back |
| `GET` | `/v1/kanban/tasks/{task_id}/artifacts?board=default` | Bounded latest-completion artifact manifest |
| `GET` | `/v1/kanban/tasks/{task_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}?board=default` | Download one manifest-bound artifact |

Task details include a `kanbanrev_…` revision. Send that exact value plus a
new idempotency key with every action. The API rejects stale state before it
changes anything, and a safe retry returns fresh state without repeating the
operation. Supported actions are `assign`, `comment`/`reply`, `promote`,
`block`, `retry`, and `terminate`.

When `kanban_artifacts` version 1 is advertised, a completed API-created task
may expose files explicitly declared by its latest successful
`kanban_complete` call. Ordinary local Kanban tasks are never exposed through
this remote API.
The manifest contains opaque IDs, safe names, media types, byte counts,
timestamps, and SHA-256 digests—never filesystem paths. Downloads require the
same bearer authentication and set private/no-store and nosniff headers.

The artifact surface allows at most 10 files, 100 MiB per file, and 250 MiB
combined. It accepts common UTF-8 text/source formats and PNG, JPEG, GIF, or
WebP images. Raster files must decode structurally and stay within fixed frame
and pixel limits. Hermes serves a metadata-free canonical re-encode, not the
original container, so unknown chunks and embedded or appended payloads are
discarded. Inputs, generic agent attachments, prose-mentioned paths, older
retry outputs, HTML/SVG/PDF, archives, executables, links, malformed content,
and recognizable credential material are not published. Consumers must verify
the advertised digest and keep their own private snapshot when persistence is
needed.

The API otherwise omits attachment locations, worker PIDs and locks, run
metadata, and raw event payloads. It is a server-to-server control surface, not
a replacement for the authenticated interactive dashboard or a remote
workspace browser.

## Long-term memory scoping (`X-Hermes-Session-Key`)

Multi-user frontends like Open WebUI need a stable per-channel identifier for long-term memory (Honcho, etc.) that is **independent** of the transcript-scoped `X-Hermes-Session-Id` (which rotates on `/new`). Pass `X-Hermes-Session-Key` on `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, or `/v1/runs` and Hermes threads it through to `AIAgent(gateway_session_key=...)`, where the Honcho memory provider uses it to derive a stable scope.

```http
POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer ***
X-Hermes-Session-Id: transcript-alpha
X-Hermes-Session-Key: agent:main:webui:dm:user-42
```

Rules: max 256 chars, control characters (`\r`, `\n`, `\x00`) are rejected, and the value is echoed back on responses (JSON + SSE). `/v1/capabilities` advertises support via `"session_key_header": "X-Hermes-Session-Key"`. Without the key, Honcho's `per-session` strategy produces a different scope per `session_id` — exactly the behavior Hermes had before.

## System Prompt Handling

When a frontend sends a `system` message (Chat Completions) or `instructions` field (Responses API), hermes-agent **layers it on top** of its core system prompt. Your agent keeps all its tools, memory, and skills — the frontend's system prompt adds extra instructions.

This means you can customize behavior per-frontend without losing capabilities:
- Open WebUI system prompt: "You are a Python expert. Always include type hints."
- The agent still has terminal, file tools, web search, memory, etc.

## Authentication

Bearer token auth via the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer ***
```

Configure the key via `API_SERVER_KEY` env var. If you need a browser to call Hermes directly, also set `API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS` to an explicit allowlist.

:::warning Security
The API server gives full access to hermes-agent's toolset, **including terminal commands**. `API_SERVER_KEY` is **required for every deployment**, including the default loopback bind on `127.0.0.1`. Keep `API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS` narrow to control browser access when you explicitly allow browser callers.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `API_SERVER_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the API server |
| `API_SERVER_PORT` | `8642` | HTTP server port |
| `API_SERVER_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (localhost only by default) |
| `API_SERVER_KEY` | _(required)_ | Bearer token for auth |
| `API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS` | _(none)_ | Comma-separated allowed browser origins |
| `API_SERVER_MODEL_NAME` | _(profile name)_ | Model name on `/v1/models`. Defaults to profile name, or `hermes-agent` for default profile. |

### config.yaml

```yaml
# Not yet supported — use environment variables.
# config.yaml support coming in a future release.
```

## Security Headers

All responses include security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — prevents MIME type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` — prevents referrer leakage

## CORS

The API server does **not** enable browser CORS by default.

For direct browser access, set an explicit allowlist:

```bash
API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

When CORS is enabled:
- **Preflight responses** include `Access-Control-Max-Age: 600` (10 minute cache)
- **SSE streaming responses** include CORS headers so browser EventSource clients work correctly
- **`Idempotency-Key`** is an allowed request header — clients can send it for deduplication (responses are cached by key for 5 minutes)

Most documented frontends such as Open WebUI connect server-to-server and do not need CORS at all.

## Compatible Frontends

Any frontend that supports the OpenAI API format works. Tested/documented integrations:

| [Open WebUI](/user-guide/messaging/open-webui) | 126k | Full guide available |
| LobeChat | 73k | Custom provider endpoint |
| LibreChat | 34k | Custom endpoint in librechat.yaml |

| big-AGI | 7k | Custom endpoint |
| OpenAI Python SDK | — | `OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8642/v1")` |
| curl | — | Direct HTTP requests |

## Multi-User Setup with Profiles

To give multiple users their own isolated Hermes instance (separate config, memory, skills), use [profiles](/user-guide/profiles):

```bash
# Create a profile per user
hermes profile create alice
hermes profile create bob

# Configure each profile's API server on a different port. API_SERVER_* are env
# vars (not config.yaml keys), so write them to each profile's .env:
cat >> ~/.hermes/profiles/alice/.env <<EOF
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
API_SERVER_PORT=8643
API_SERVER_KEY=alice-secret
EOF

cat >> ~/.hermes/profiles/bob/.env <<EOF
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
API_SERVER_PORT=8644
API_SERVER_KEY=bob-secret
EOF

# Start each profile's gateway
hermes -p alice gateway &
hermes -p bob gateway &
```

Each profile's API server automatically advertises the profile name as the model ID:

- `http://localhost:8643/v1/models` → model `alice`
- `http://localhost:8644/v1/models` → model `bob`

In Open WebUI, add each as a separate connection. The model dropdown shows `alice` and `bob` as distinct models, each backed by a fully isolated Hermes instance. See the [Open WebUI guide](/user-guide/messaging/open-webui#multi-user-setup-with-profiles) for details.

## Limitations

### Remote profile runtime switching

Authenticated control planes can discover this optional surface through
`GET /v1/capabilities`. Version one exposes a secret-free runtime inventory at
`GET /v1/profiles/{profile_id}/runtime` and a revision-bound switch at
`POST /v1/profiles/{profile_id}/runtime/switch`. The switch accepts only an
advertised provider/model pair plus the exact inventory revision and an
idempotency key. Hermes rejects stale revisions, mismatched idempotency-key
reuse, unserved profiles, and profiles with an active API-server run. It never
accepts provider credentials or endpoint URLs through this remote route.

- **Response storage** — stored responses (for `previous_response_id`) are persisted in SQLite and survive gateway restarts. Max 100 stored responses (LRU eviction).
- **No file upload** — inline images are supported on both `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses`, but uploaded files (`file`, `input_file`, `file_id`) and non-image document inputs are not supported through the API.
- **Model field is cosmetic** — the `model` field in requests is accepted but the actual LLM model used is configured server-side in config.yaml.

## Proxy Mode

The API server also serves as the backend for **gateway proxy mode**. When another Hermes gateway instance is configured with `GATEWAY_PROXY_URL` pointing at this API server, it forwards all messages here instead of running its own agent. This enables split deployments — for example, a Docker container handling Matrix E2EE that relays to a host-side agent.

See [Matrix Proxy Mode](/user-guide/messaging/matrix#proxy-mode-e2ee-on-macos) for the full setup guide.
